I am a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Arizona, where I work with Professor [Peter Behroozi](https://www.peterbehroozi.com/) and his group to study how galaxies form and evolve, the role of dark matter in this process, and how machine learning can be used to expand our knowledge in these areas.
