I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Arizona, where I work with Professor [Peter Behroozi](https://www.peterbehroozi.com/) to study how galaxies form and evolve, the role of dark matter in this process, and how machine learning can be used to expand our knowledge in these areas. 

I am also interested in using galaxies to probe cosmology and how AI will be used in Stage IV Cosmology Surveys. In this area, I work with Professor Tim Eifler and the [Arizona Cosmology Lab](https://cosmolab.arizona.edu/), and am a member of the [Roman HLIS Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team](https://roman-hlis-cosmology.caltech.edu/).
